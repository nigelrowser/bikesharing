## Overview
The NYC CitiBike Data covers information about data recorded in August 2019. In the visualizations in the upcoming slides cutomer, gender, and bike trends are analyzed. With this analysis investors are provided with the data needed to make an informed decision on if a CitiBike franchise should be opened in Des Moines, Iowa.
## Project Details
To create visualizations for this project a csv file was download and imported into the Pandas Python Library. The tripduration datatype was changed to a datetime datatype. A updated csv file was then exported.
